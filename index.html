          <span class="headline hl3">A Level Results and a Day at Seal Bay Resort</span>

        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>By the time this goes to print, pupils across Chichester will be receiving their A Level results and I know anticipation is high and there will be some trepidation as people open their envelopes and think about their next steps.</p>
          This year exam grading is returning to normal and I know some pupils and parents will be wondering why. During the pandemic, necessary changes to the way grades were assessed meant results were generally higher. Moving back is ultimately about fairness, and is important to ensure qualifications, and distinctions between grades, independent of when they were earned, hold their value. That means pupils can continue to get the opportunities they deserve, but it will also, in the short term, mean grades return to be more similar to those awarded pre-pandemic in 2019. Our universities are well aware of the change and have reflected this in their grading expectations. Rest assured that there also remains some protection built in, should exam performance nationally remain affected by the pandemic.</p>
          Congratulations to everyone receiving results today, as well as all our fantastic teachers who helped them get here today. Whatever the paper says, remember there is a wide range of opportunities available to you. Your school, college, UCAS Clearing and National Careers Service are all on hand to guide you.</View> </p>

        Another big part of my job as your MP is to make sure our economy is performing to its potential. We have several highly successful local industries, spanning our excellent wine growers and thriving fresh food and drinks businesses. One of our largest, however, is tourism, which alone brings in more than £300 million annually and supports over 6,000 jobs.</p>
        <p>These are huge numbers, and, particularly around their peak season, I like to check in with local businesses to see how they’re doing. Most recently, I visited Seal Bay Resort, one of our brilliant holiday resorts on the Selsey coast. As someone who spent countless happy summers at caravan park resorts as a child, it was fantastic to see so many having such a great time. You’re spoiled for choice across their new £18 million entertainment complex, mile-long beachfront and their range of restaurants, and the team there couldn’t do enough to help. Thank you again to Antony at Cove UK for making us feel so welcome – I look forward to practising my surfing on the new Wave Rider when I’m next around!
